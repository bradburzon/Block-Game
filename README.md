# Block-Game (best used with Samsung Galaxy)
An android mobile gaming app. The user, a blue block, is to cross the horizontally moving red boxes as far as possible. Each tap, a single move up, adds a score to the user. The difficulty gets harder as the user get farther. When user collides with a red block, the score is displayed in the middle as well as a reset button.

As the block continues to go up, the screen will adjust to the block and make it the middle.
